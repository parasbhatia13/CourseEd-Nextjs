This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Course Ed- 
I have created a app using the nextjs in which user can add git username in the .env and then in the app users will be able to the list of the respos in the code section and on click of that user will redirect to the component where details of the repo like description and branches as well
On home there are few courses that are created in the data.json  and users can search for thecourses as well on the home page .. In this app there is a snippet of code that is showing how to use the body and query in the route handler.
